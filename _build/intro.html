<div style="clear:both;"></div><p>Jupyter Books lets you build an online book using a collection of Jupyter Notebooks
and Markdown files. Its output is similar to the excellent <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/">Bookdown</a> tool,
and adds extra functionality for people running a Jupyter stack.</p>
<p>For an example of a book built with Jupyter Books, see the <a href="https://www.textbook.ds100.org/">textbook for Data 100</a> at UC Berkeley (or this website!)</p>
<p>Here are a few features of Jupyter Books</p>
<ul>
<li>A Command-Line Interface (CLI) to quickly create, build, and upgrade books.</li>
<li>Write book content in markdown and Jupyter Notebooks</li>
<li>Convert these into Jekyll pages that can be hosted for free on GitHub</li>
<li>Pages can have <a href="https://mybinder.org">Binder</a>, JupyterHub, or <a href="https://thebelab.readthedocs.io">Thebelab</a> links
automatically added for interactivity.</li>
<li>The website itself is based on Jekyll and is highly extensible.</li>
<li>There are lots of nifty HTML features under-the-hood, such as
Turbolinks fast-navigation and click-to-copy in code cells.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out other features in the <a href="features/features">Features section</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Getting-started">Getting started<a class="anchor-link" href="#Getting-started"> </a></h2><p><em>This documentation is for the <a href="https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book">master branch of Jupyter Book</a>, which
means that it might be slightly out-of-date with the
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/jupyter-book/">latest version released</a> on pip</em>.</p>
<p>To get started, you may be interested in the following links.
Here are a few links of interest:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><a href="features/features">Jupyter Book features</a></strong> is a quick demo and overview
of Jupyter Books.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><a href="guide/01_overview">The Jupyter Book Guide</a></strong>
will step you through the process of configuring and building your own Jupyter Book.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Installation">Installation<a class="anchor-link" href="#Installation"> </a></h3><p>To install the Jupyter Book command-line interface (CLI), use <code>pip</code>!</p>

<pre><code>pip install jupyter-book</code></pre>
<p>alternatively, if you'd like to install the latest version from GitHub,
you can run:</p>

<pre><code>pip install git+https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book</code></pre>
<p>This will install the <em>master branch</em> of Jupyter Book (what these docs are
built from), though it might be a bit less-stable.</p>
<h3 id="Create-a-new-book">Create a new book<a class="anchor-link" href="#Create-a-new-book"> </a></h3><p>Once you've installed the CLI, create a new book using the demo book content
(the website that you're viewing now) with this command:</p>

<pre><code>jupyter-book create mybookname --demo</code></pre>
<h3 id="Build-the-markdown-for-your-book">Build the markdown for your book<a class="anchor-link" href="#Build-the-markdown-for-your-book"> </a></h3><p>Now, build the markdown that Jekyll will use for your book. Run this command:</p>

<pre><code>jupyter-book build mybookname</code></pre>
<h3 id="That's-it!">That's it!<a class="anchor-link" href="#That's-it!"> </a></h3><p>You can now either push your book to GitHub and serve the demo with gh-pages,
or modify the book with your own content.</p>
