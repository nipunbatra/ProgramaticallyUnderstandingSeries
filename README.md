# ProgramaticallyUnderstandingSeries

This repository contains a collection of IPython (Jupyter) notebooks that programatically explain concepts in statistics, machine learning, data science, etc. During my PhD., I had created these notebooks to get a better understanding of the concepts. It was often easier for me to understand an algorithm or concept if I could program it and then play around with the parameters and visualise the effect.
