# ProgramaticallyUnderstandingSeries

This repository contains a collection of IPython (Jupyter) notebooks that programatically explain concepts in statistics, machine learning, data science, etc. During my PhD., I had created these notebooks to get a better understanding of the concepts. It was often easier for me to understand an algorithm or concept if I could program it and then play around with the parameters and visualise the effect. I have been inspired by many CS reseachers who blog about CS and research. To name a few: [Andrej Karpathy](http://karpathy.github.io/), [Jake Vanderplas](https://jakevdp.github.io/), [Randal Olson](http://www.randalolson.com/blog/), [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/), among others.
