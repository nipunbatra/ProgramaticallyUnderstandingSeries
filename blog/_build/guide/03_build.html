<p>Once you've added content and configured your book, it's time to
build the HTML for each <strong>page</strong> of your book. We'll use the
<code>jupyter-book build</code> command-line tool for this. In the <em>next step</em>,
we'll stitch these HTML pages into a book.</p>
<h2 id="Prerequisites">Prerequisites<a class="anchor-link" href="#Prerequisites"> </a></h2><p>In order to build the HTML for each page, you should have followed the steps
in <a href="02_create.html">creating your Jupyter Book structure</a>. You should have
a Jupyter Book structure in a local folder on your computer, a collection
of notebook/markdown files in your <code>content/</code> folder, a <code>_data/toc.yml</code> file
that defines the structure of your book, and any configuration you'd like
in the <code>config.yml</code> file.</p>
<h2 id="Build-each-page's-HTML">Build each page's HTML<a class="anchor-link" href="#Build-each-page's-HTML"> </a></h2><p>Now that your book's content is in the <code>content/</code> folder and you've
defined your book's structure in <code>_data/toc.yml</code>, you can build
the HTML for each page of your book.</p>
<p>Do so by running the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>jupyter-book build mybookname/
</pre></div>
<p>This will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the links specified in the <code>_data/toc.yml</code> file (pointing to files in <code>/content/</code>) and
do the following:<ul>
<li>Run <code>nbconvert</code> to turn the content files (e.g., <code>.ipynb</code>, <code>.md</code>, etc) files into HTML</li>
<li>Replace relative image file paths so that they work on your new built book</li>
<li>Place all these generated files in the <code>mybookname/_build/</code> directory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After this step is finished, you should have a collection of HTML files in your
<code>_build/</code> folder.</p>
<h3 id="Page-HTML-caching">Page HTML caching<a class="anchor-link" href="#Page-HTML-caching"> </a></h3><p>By default, Jupyter Book will only build the HTML for pages that have
been updated since the last time you built the book. This helps reduce the
amount of unnecessary time needed to build your book. If you'd like to
force Jupyter Book to re-build a particular page, you can either edit the
corresponding file in the <code>content/</code> folder, or delete that page's HTML
in the <code>_build/</code> folder.</p>
<h2 id="Next-step:-build-and-publish-your-book">Next step: build and publish your book<a class="anchor-link" href="#Next-step:-build-and-publish-your-book"> </a></h2><p>Now that you've created the HTML for each page of your book, it's time
to stitch them together into a book. That's covered in the next section.</p>
