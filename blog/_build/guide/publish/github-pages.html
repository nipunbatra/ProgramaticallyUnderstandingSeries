<p>GitHub pages is a <a href="https://pages.github.com/">free service that GitHub provides</a> to let you host website content
using your GitHub repositories.</p>
<p>Once you've built the intermediate files for your book (in <code>_build</code>) or built the HTML
for your book (in <code>_site</code>), you can push your book contents to GitHub so that
others can access your book.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>If you are building your book's HTML manually</strong></p>
<p>We assume that you have already <a href="book-html.html">built your book's HTML</a> and that
your HTML content is in the <code>_site/</code> folder. We also assume that you have a
<a href="../03_build.html#Create-an-online-repository-for-your-book">GitHub repository created for your book</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>If you are using GitHub-page's Jekyll builder</strong></p>
<p>We assume that you have a
<a href="../03_build.html#Create-an-online-repository-for-your-book">GitHub repository created for your book</a>.
We also assume that your book's template and content have been pushed to
your GitHub repository.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Publish-your-book's-HTML-manually-to-GitHub-pages">Publish your book's HTML manually to GitHub-pages<a class="anchor-link" href="#Publish-your-book's-HTML-manually-to-GitHub-pages"> </a></h2><p>You can manually publish HTML to GitHub-pages so that it will serve a website
for you. To do so, we'll need to push the HTML for our book to a branch, tell GitHub-pages
that this branch contains raw HTML (not a Jekyll template), and then activate
GitHub-pages on the repository. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Confirm that your book's HTML is built. You should see a
collection of HTML files/folders in the <code>_site</code> folder.</li>
<li><p>Install the <code>ghp-import</code> tool. This is a command-line tool for
quickly pushing some built HTML to a GitHub-pages branch.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pip install ghp-import
</pre></div>
</li>
<li><p>Use <code>ghp-import</code> to push your book's HTML onto the <code>gh-pages</code> branch of your repository.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>ghp-import -n -p -f _site
</pre></div>
<p>The <code>-n</code> adds a <code>.nojekyll</code> file to your book's built HTML, and the <code>-p</code> and <code>-f</code> tell
<code>ghp-import</code> to push the contents of <code>_site/</code> to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch. Run <code>ghp-import -h</code>
to see more configuration options for this tool.</p>
</li>
<li>Confirm that your <code>gh-pages</code> branch has newly-pushed HTML for your book. You should see
a <code>.nojekyll</code> file as well as the contents of <code>_site/</code> in the <strong>root</strong> of your <code>gh-pages</code> branch.</li>
<li><p>Enable GitHub site building for your repository.</p>
<p>From your GitHub repository, click <code>Settings</code> then scroll down to the
<code>GitHub Pages</code> section. You should see the message <code>Your site is published at &lt;YOUR-URL&gt;</code>.
Ensure that you're building from the <code>gh-pages</code> branch.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Go to the URL listed at <code>&lt;YOUR-URL&gt;</code> and you should see your live site.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Automatically-build-your-book's-HTML-with-the-GitHub-Pages-Jekyll-builder">Automatically build your book's HTML with the GitHub Pages Jekyll builder<a class="anchor-link" href="#Automatically-build-your-book's-HTML-with-the-GitHub-Pages-Jekyll-builder"> </a></h2><p>You'll need to activate GitHub-pages on your repository in order to tell GitHub
to host a website from the repository's contents.
To do so, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Confirm that each page's HTML is built. You should see a
collection of HTML files/folders in the <code>_build</code> folder.</li>
<li>Commit and push the changes to your repository.</li>
<li><p>Enable GitHub site building for your repository.</p>
<p>From your GitHub repository, click <code>Settings</code> then scroll down to the
<code>GitHub Pages</code> section. You should see the message <code>Your site is published at &lt;YOUR-URL&gt;</code>.
Ensure that you're building from the correct folder.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Go to the URL listed at <code>&lt;YOUR-URL&gt;</code> and you should see your live site.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That should be all that is needed for GitHub Pages to automatically build
and publish your site. Any time you push changes to the <code>_build/</code> folder
(by running <code>jupyter-book build</code> locally and pushing the changes to GitHub),
your book content will update.</p>
