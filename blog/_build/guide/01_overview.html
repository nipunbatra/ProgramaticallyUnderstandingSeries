<p>This is a guide for creating your own book using
Jupyter Notebooks and Jekyll. Book content is written in markdown and
Jupyter Notebooks, and <code>jupyter-book</code> converts these into
a book fit for hosting on the web.</p>
<h2 id="Install-the-command-line-interface">Install the command-line interface<a class="anchor-link" href="#Install-the-command-line-interface"> </a></h2><p>First off, make sure you have the CLI installed so that you can work with Jupyter Book.
The Jupyter-Book CLI allows you to create, build, upgrade, and otherwise control your
Jupyter Book. You can install it via pip with the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pip install jupyter-book
</pre></div>
<h2 id="The-book-building-process">The book building process<a class="anchor-link" href="#The-book-building-process"> </a></h2><p>Building a Jupyter Book broadly consists of three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Create your book template</strong>. Jupyter Book expects a particular
collection of files and folders that work with the Static Site Generator
Jekyll. The <a href="01-5_tour.html">anatomy of a Jupyter Book</a> section covers the
general structure of Jupyter Books, and the <a href="02_create.html">create your book template</a>
guide shows how to create your own book structure.</li>
<li><strong>Convert each page of your book into HTML</strong>. We first create each page of
your book into HTML. This converts your <code>.ipynb</code>, <code>.md</code>, etc files into HTML
that can be understood by a website. It also uses your book's metadata to insert
tags and other layout elements into each page's HTML. See the <a href="03_build.html">building each page's HTML</a>
section for more information.</li>
<li><strong>Build your book's HTML from these pages</strong>. Once we have HTML for each page, we
can stitch them together for a book. At the end of this step, you should have
standalone HTML that can be hosted online. See the <a href="publish/book-html.html">build your book's html</a>
section for more information.</li>
<li><strong>Host your book's HTML online</strong>. Once your book's HTML is built, you can host
it online as a public website. This guide <a href="04_publish.html">covers a few ways to do this</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>To begin, check out the next section. You can follow this guide linearly, or use it as
a reference later on.</p>
