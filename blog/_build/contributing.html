<p>Welcome to the <code>jupyter-book</code> repository! We're excited you're here and want to contribute.</p>
<p>These guidelines are designed to make it as easy as possible to get involved.
If you have any questions that aren't discussed below, please let us know by opening an <a href="https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book/issues">issue</a>!</p>
<p>Before you start you'll need to set up a free <a href="https://github.com/https://github.com/jupyter/governance/blob/master/conduct/code_of_conduct.md">GitHub</a> account and sign in.
Here are some <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account">instructions</a>.</p>
<p>Already know what you're looking for in this guide? Use the TOC to the right
to navigate this page!</p>
<h2 id="Joining-the-conversation">Joining the conversation<a class="anchor-link" href="#Joining-the-conversation"> </a></h2><p><code>jupyter-book</code> is a young project maintained by a growing group of enthusiastic developers&mdash; and we're excited to have you join!
Most of our discussions will take place on open <a href="https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book/issues">issues</a>.</p>
<p>As a reminder, we expect all contributors to <code>jupyter-book</code> to adhere to the <a href="https://github.com/jupyter/governance/blob/master/conduct/code_of_conduct.md">Jupyter Code of Conduct</a> in these conversations.</p>
<h2 id="Contributing-through-GitHub">Contributing through GitHub<a class="anchor-link" href="#Contributing-through-GitHub"> </a></h2><p><a href="https://git-scm.com">git</a> is a really useful tool for version control.
<a href="https://github.com/https://github.com/jupyter/governance/blob/master/conduct/code_of_conduct.md">GitHub</a> sits on top of git and supports collaborative and distributed working.</p>
<p>You'll use <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown">Markdown</a> to chat in issues and pull requests on GitHub.
You can think of Markdown as a few little symbols around your text that will allow GitHub
to render the text with formatting.
For example you could write words as bold (<code>**bold**</code>), or in italics (<code>*italics*</code>),
or as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">link</a> (<code>[link](https://https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)</code>) to another webpage.</p>
<p>GitHub has a helpful page on

<h2 id="Understanding-issues,-milestones-and-project-boards">Understanding issues, milestones and project boards<a class="anchor-link" href="#Understanding-issues,-milestones-and-project-boards"> </a></h2><p>Every project on GitHub uses <a href="https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book/issues">issues</a> slightly differently.</p>
<p>The following outlines how the <code>jupyter-book</code> developers think about these tools.</p>
<p><strong>Issues</strong> are individual pieces of work that need to be completed to move the project forwards.
A general guideline: if you find yourself tempted to write a great big issue that
is difficult to describe as one unit of work, please consider splitting it into two or more issues.</p>
<p>Issues are assigned <a href="#issue-labels">labels</a> which explain how they relate to the overall project's
goals and immediate next steps.</p>
<h3 id="Issue-labels">Issue labels<a class="anchor-link" href="#Issue-labels"> </a></h3><p>The current list of labels are <a href="https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book/labels">here</a> and include:</p>
<ul>

<h2 id="Repository-Structure-of-Jupyter-Book">Repository Structure of Jupyter Book<a class="anchor-link" href="#Repository-Structure-of-Jupyter-Book"> </a></h2><p>This section covers the general structure of the
<a href="https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book">Jupyter Book repository</a>, and
explains which pieces are where.</p>
<p>The Jupyter Book repository contains two main pieces:</p>
<h3 id="The-command-line-tool-and-Python-package">The command-line tool and Python package<a class="anchor-link" href="#The-command-line-tool-and-Python-package"> </a></h3><p>This is used to help create and build books.
It can be found at <a href="https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book/tree/master/jupyter_book"><code>./jupyter_book</code></a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The <code>page</code> module builds single pages</strong>. This module is meant to be self-contained for
converting single <code>.ipynb</code>/<code>.md</code>/etc pages into HTML. Jupyter Book uses this module when
building entire books, but the module can also be used on its own (it's what <code>jupyter-book page</code> uses).
You can find the module at: <a href="https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book/tree/master/jupyter_book/page"><code>jupyter_book/page</code></a>.</li>
<li><strong>The <code>create.py</code> and <code>build.py</code> create and build a book</strong>. They connect with the CLI and
are used to process multiple pages and stitch them together into a static website template.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="The-template-SSG-website">The template SSG website<a class="anchor-link" href="#The-template-SSG-website"> </a></h3><p>This is used when generating new books. This website defines the structure of
the site that is created when you run <code>jupyter-book create</code>. It contains the Javascript, CSS, and
HTML structure of a book. It can be found at
<a href="https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book/tree/master/jupyter_book/book_template"><code>jupyter_book/book_template</code></a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book/tree/master/jupyter_book/book_template/_includes"><code>_includes/</code></a>
folder contains core HTML and javascript files for the site. For example,
<a href="https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book/blob/master/jupyter_book/book_template/_includes/head.html"><code>_includes/head.html</code></a> contains the HTML for the header of each page, which is where CSS and JS files are linked.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book/tree/master/jupyter_book/book_template/assets"><code>assets/</code></a>
folder contains static CSS/JS files that don't depend on site configuration.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book/tree/master/jupyter_book/book_template/_sass"><code>_sass/</code></a>
folder contains all of the book and page CSS rules. This is stitched together in a single CSS file
at build time (SCSS is a way to split up CSS rules among multiple files). Within this folder, the
<a href="https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book/tree/master/jupyter_book/book_template/_sass/page"><code>_sass/page/</code></a> folder
has CSS files for a single page of content, while the other folders/files contain CSS rules for
the whole book.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book/tree/master/jupyter_book/book_template/content"><code>content/</code></a>
folder contains the content for the Jupyter Book documentation (e.g., the <a href="https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book/tree/master/jupyter_book/book_template/content/contributing.md">markdown for this page</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="An-example">An example<a class="anchor-link" href="#An-example"> </a></h3><p>Here are a few examples of how this code gets used to help you get started.</p>
<ul>
<li>when somebody runs <code>jupyter-book create mybook/</code>, the <code>create.py</code> module is used to generate an empty template using the template in <code>jupyter_book/book_template/</code>.</li>
<li>when somebody runs <code>jupyter-book build mybook/</code>, the <code>build.py</code> module to loop through your page content files,
and uses the <code>page/</code> module to convert each one into HTML and places it in <code>mybook/_build</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully this explanation gets you situated and helps you understand how the pieces all fit together.

<h2 id="Making-a-change">Making a change<a class="anchor-link" href="#Making-a-change"> </a></h2><p>We appreciate all contributions to <code>jupyter-book</code>, but those accepted fastest will follow a workflow similar to the following:</p>
<p><strong>1. Comment on an existing issue or open a new issue referencing your addition.</strong></p>
<p>This allows other members of the jupyter-book development team to confirm that you aren't overlapping with work that's currently underway and that everyone is on the same page with the goal of the work you're going to carry out.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.igvita.com/2011/12/19/dont-push-your-pull-requests/">This blog</a> is a nice explanation of why putting this work in up front is so useful to everyone involved.</p>
<p><strong>2. <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">Fork</a> the <a href="https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book">jupyter-book repository</a> to your profile.</strong></p>
<p>This is now your own unique copy of jupyter-book.
Changes here won't effect anyone else's work, so it's a safe space to explore edits to the code!</p>
<p>Make sure to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/">keep your fork up to date</a> with the master repository.</p>
<p><strong>3. Make the changes you've discussed.</strong></p>
<p>Try to keep the changes focused.
We've found that working on a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/">new branch</a> makes it easier to keep your changes targeted.</p>
<p><strong>4. Submit a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/">pull request</a>.</strong></p>
<p>A member of the development team will review your changes to confirm that they can be merged into the main code base.
When opening the pull request, we ask that you follow some <a href="#pull-requests">specific conventions</a>.
We outline these below.</p>
<h3 id="Pull-Requests">Pull Requests<a class="anchor-link" href="#Pull-Requests"> </a></h3><p>To improve understanding pull requests "at a glance", we encourage the use of several standardized tags.
When opening a pull request, please use at least one of the following prefixes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>[BRK]</strong> for changes which break existing builds or tests</li>
<li><strong>[DOC]</strong> for new or updated documentation</li>
<li><strong>[ENH]</strong> for enhancements</li>
<li><strong>[FIX]</strong> for bug fixes</li>
<li><strong>[REF]</strong> for refactoring existing code</li>
<li><strong>[STY]</strong> for stylistic changes</li>
<li><strong>[TST]</strong> for new or updated tests, and</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also combine the tags above, for example if you are updating both a test and
the documentation: <strong>[TST, DOC]</strong>.</p>
<p>Pull requests should be submitted early and often!</p>
<p>If your pull request is not yet ready to be merged, please open your pull request as a draft.
More information about doing this is <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/#draft-pull-requests">available in GitHub's documentation</a>.
This tells the development team that your pull request is a "work-in-progress",
and that you plan to continue working on it.</p>
<p>When your pull request is Ready for Review, you can select this option on the PR's page,
and a project maintainer will review your proposed changes.</p>
