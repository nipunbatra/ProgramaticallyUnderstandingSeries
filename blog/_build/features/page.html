<p>Sometimes you'd like to build a single page of content rather than an
entire book. For example, if you'd like to generate a web-friendly HTML
page from a Jupyter Notebook for a report or publication.</p>
<p>You can generate a standalone HTML file for a single page of Jupyter Book
content by running the following command:</p>

<pre><code>jupyter-book page path/to/mybook.ipynb</code></pre>
<p>This will do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Convert your page to HTML</li>
<li>Add the Jupyter Book CSS and Javascript to the header of
that HTML.</li>
<li>Write the result to disk</li>
</ol>
<p>The page's HTML will be missing a few Jupyter Book features, such as
a Table of Contents, however the layout and style will largely be the
same. <a href="/notebooks.html">Here is an example of what this looks like</a>.</p>
