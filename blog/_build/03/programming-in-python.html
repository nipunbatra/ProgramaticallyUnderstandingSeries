<p>Programming can dramatically improve our ability to collect and analyze information
about the world, which in turn can lead to discoveries through the kind of careful
reasoning demonstrated in the previous section. In data science, the purpose of
writing a program is to instruct a computer to carry out the steps of an analysis.
Computers cannot study the world on their own. People must describe precisely what
steps the computer should take in order to collect and analyze data, and those steps
are expressed through programs.</p>
